### BSidesLV Overview
[BSides Las Vegas](https://bsideslv.org) (or BSidesLV) is the original, and still the largest Security BSides event in the world. Since its founding in 2009, BSides Las Vegas has grown year-over-year, now hosting 3,000 attendees. The Security BSides series of non-commercial conferences has seen hundreds of events in hundreds of cities, each run by a dedicated group of volunteers.

The annual two-day event started as an 'un-conference' supporting talks previously rejected by Black Hat, and has since grown to one of the must attend events of the summer. BSides Las Vegas is a source of education, communication, and collaboration. The technical and academic presentations are given in the spirit of peer review and for the dissemination of knowledge among all specialties. Sometimes called a "hacker family reunion," BSides Las Vegas may be the friendliest environment of the three major conferences at Hacker Summer Camp.
