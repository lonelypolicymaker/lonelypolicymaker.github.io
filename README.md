# The Lost Policymaker's Guide to Hacker Summer Camp

The Lost Policymaker is a tongue-in-cheek nod to all the great travel guides that have given aid and comfort to those who seek new experiences in unknown spaces. We hope it will serve you in the same capacity as you travel through hacker conferences in the Las Vegas desert, affectionately known as Hacker Summer Camp.

## Getting Started

Even for hackers, our first journey to Hacker Summer Camp is often overwhelming. It takes a year or two to figure out how we want to experience the sensory overload. For those not accustomed to hacker culture, it's doubly disorienting.

The inaugural [Lost Policymaker's Guide to Hacker Summer Camp](https://lostpolicymaker.org/LostPolicymaker_HackerSummerCamp_2019.pdf) helps those in the policy field more quickly gain their footing at the events and understand hacker ethos and culture. Guiding new attendees gives them the best possible chance for an authentic experience the first time at Hacker Summer Camp - even if they hate it.
