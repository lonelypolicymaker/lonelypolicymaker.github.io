The Lost Policymaker is a tongue-in-cheek nod to all the great travel guides that have given aid and comfort to those who seek new experiences in unknown spaces. We hope it will serve you in the same capacity as you travel through hacker conferences in the Las Vegas desert, affectionately known as Hacker Summer Camp.

## Getting Started

Even for hackers, our first journey to Hacker Summer Camp is often overwhelming. It takes a year or two to figure out how we want to experience the sensory overload. For those not accustomed to hacker culture, it's doubly disorienting. The inaugural [Lost Policymaker's Guide to Hacker Summer Camp](LostPolicymaker_HackerSummerCamp_2019.pdf) helps those in the policy field more quickly gain their footing at the events and understand hacker ethos and culture.

The goal is to reduce the barrier to entry for the public policy community (those who already plan on attending), at the federal, state, local, and international levels. To give them the best possible chance to have an authentic, tailored experience there. Even if they end up hating Hacker Summer Camp, they should hate it fairly.
