The Lost Policymaker's Guide is a travel guide, faithful companion, and resource for the DEF CON Policy experience. DEF CON Policy is a guided experience for government officials, public policy members and staff to explore and get the most out of DEF CON 27. Activities and support includes: advance registration, daily policy pocket guide schedule, invitations to DEF CON policy roundtables, 1:1 guided tours and meetings with DEF CON communities, villages and speakers. 

This site has two primary purposes:

* Hosting the PDF version of [the Guide](LostPolicymaker_HackerSummerCamp_2019.pdf) so you have easy access to it.
* Providing quick links to reference material that might be more useful in an interactive format.

Please check out the links at the top of the page for more information, and enjoy DEF CON!
