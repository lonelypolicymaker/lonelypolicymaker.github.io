## About the Lost Policymaker Guide
The Lost Policymaker is a tongue-in-cheek nod to all the great travel guides that have given aid and comfort to those who seek new experiences in unknown spaces. We hope it will serve you in the same capacity as you travel through a hacker conference or three, whether that's in the heat of the Las Vegas desert, the friendly confines of Washington D.C., the wild west coast in San Francisco, or elsewhere.

In recent years public policymakers have increasingly frequented hacker and infosec conferences. This guide can serve as a reference and roadmap to help those in the policy field more quickly gain their footing at the events and understand hacker ethos and culture. The four conferences featured in this guide represent some of the top hacker and infosec conferences in the world.

### Shmoocon

[Shmoocon](https://shmoocon.org) ([@Shmoocon](https://twitter.com/shmoocon)) is a small, low-key hacker conference in Washington D.C. with a near-cult following and a sense of humor. Its logo is a moose. [Learn more about Shmoocon...](shmoocon)
